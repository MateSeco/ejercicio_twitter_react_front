This project was developed as one the challenges proposed in a coding bootcamp at [Hack Academy](https://ha.edu.uy/) by [Soledad Sienra](https://github.com/solesienra/) and [Ignacio Abadie](https://github.com/MateSeco/).<br/>
In this repository we developed the front-end of the application.
The back-end is kept in a different repository.

## Technologies used

We worked with the MERN Stack:

We used Redux to manage the state of the application and to keep it stored.<br/>
Authorization is given via JWT and passwords kept in DB are encrypted.<br/>
MongoDB Atlas was used as cloud database.<br/>
We also used AWS S3 for Cloud Storage of the user's profile pictures.<br/>

## What we did

A social media application that might be insipred in a real life example :see_no_evil: :innocent:<br/>
You can register or login if you already have an user. <br/>
You can set your profile choosing an userName, giving a description of yourself and uploading a profile picture (if you don't want to, we'll give you a default one :wink:)

## Give it a try!

The app has been deployed in vercel. There's a link you can access on
